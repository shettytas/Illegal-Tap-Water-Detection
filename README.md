# ML model to detect water theft through illegal pipeline taps underground using sensor readings

Water theft through illegal pipeline taps results in significant resource loss and damages infrastructure while depriving communities of fair access to water. Conventional detection methods are slow, labor-intensive, and often ineffective against concealed or sophisticated illegal taps.  

We develop an effective, data-driven solution using sensor technologies (pressure, flow, leak, vibration) to detect illicit tapping events in real-time, conserve water, and ensure equitable distributionâ€”leveraging technology for societal good.

We use monitoring system that analyzes real-time data from a network of pressure, flow, and leak detection sensors installed throughout the water distribution network. Using machine learning and anomaly detection algorithms, the system identifies irregular patterns indicating possible illegal taps. Alerts are generated instantly for suspected cases, enabling field teams to act quickly.
